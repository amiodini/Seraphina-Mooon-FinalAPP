      <h2>Hello <strong>{firstName}</strong>,</h2>
      <p>
        A little bit of stardust has found its way to you. <strong>{senderName}</strong> has sent you a gift from <em>Seraphina Moon</em>: a personalized tarot reading woven with magic, metaphor, and a touch of cosmic insight.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not just a reading. It is an invitation. To pause. To wonder. To reflect. And maybe even to smile at what the cards whisper to you.
